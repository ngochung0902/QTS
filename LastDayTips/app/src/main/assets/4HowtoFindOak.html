So naturally, the oak logs necessary for higher level crafting will be found in the Oak Bushes, Grove, and Woods locations that are already visible on the world map. The problem, however, is that these locations are not even accessible to players. Yet.<br>Because these locations lie across the river, players will need to get an ATV up and running in order to reach those areas. The blueprints for the ATV can be obtained easily--you need only be level 18 and have 2 Crafting Points -- but obtaining all the parts for assembling it may take a bit of time and luck. Better get started.<br><br>Just remember that like the chopper's gas tank, the ATV Transmission is currently not in the game and is the missing part that's currently stopping players from reaching the Oak Bushes, Grove, and Woods.<br><br>TL;DR: You'll likely obtain oak logs in the Oak Bushes, Grove, and Woods. But for right now, those areas are totally inaccessible because the ATV Transmission needed for completing the ATV isn't in the game yet.<br>
