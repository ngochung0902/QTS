These three tools are the earliest possible schematics you can learn, and the bread and butter items from which most other items flow. So as soon as you drop into the game in your home zone, check the nearby broken down car for loot. <br><br>Then set about collecting 9 Pine Logs, 6 Limestone, and learning all 3 schematics. We recommend building the hatchet and pickaxe first, as no enemies in this area are so tough a few right hooks can't handle them -- but your hands aren't so hot at breaking limestone deposits or trees.<br><br>While they're technically not 100% necessary for harvesting raw materials or defending yourself, these three tools save valuable time and effort -- and both of them are at a premium when you're trying to get a new base camp off the ground in time to defend against the Horde. <br>
